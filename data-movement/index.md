## Overview

In this paper, we describe various memory architectures for DH systems, describe the problematics of data movement in these architectures, and demonstrate the limitations of allocators. We hope for this paper to serve as a motivation for the C++ community to tackle the challenge of improving the native capabilities of the language to deal with these limitation.
