# Public proposals for standards groups
## Codeplay Software Ltd.

## Objective of the repository

This repository contains different proposals on various working groups
that Codeplay Software Ltd. is currently involved in.

The aim of this public repository is to facilitate sharing information
with our partners and public in general.

## Structure of the repository

Each proposal is stored on a separate directory, named after the proposal
itself. Inside the directory, some proposals may have different directories
for different working groups or standards - for example, some proposals may
be combined for Khronos SYCL for OpenCL and ISO C++.

## How to contribute

We encourage interested users and developers in the community to contribute
to our proposals. Feedback can be sent via Github issues, or by forking
the repository and contributing pull requests.

Developers and members of the community can contact us directly via our
[website](https://www.codeplay.com/support/contact/).

## Status of the proposals

This repository contains proposals in different states of work,
some of them will be work in progress while others are published and finished.

* _Work In Progress_ : The proposal is still a work in progress, so large changes should be expected.
* _Draft_ : A draft of the proposal is ready, and no major changes are expected. This status normally indicates that the proposal is ready for feedback from the general public.
* _Final Draft_ : The proposal is a draft submitted to the relevant standards body, and only minor changes are expected.
